# Supermarket Product Shelving Simulation

A combined multi-processing and multi-threading simulation of a supermarket where employees place products on shelves and customers interact with the shelves.

## Overview

This project simulates the behavior of a supermarket with shelving teams and customer interactions. Shelving teams, consisting of managers and employees, are responsible for restocking shelves when product quantities fall below a threshold. Customers randomly arrive, select items, and interact with the available products.

## Features

- Multi-processing and multi-threading implementation.
- Shelving teams with managers and employees.
- Random customer arrivals and product selections.
- Termination conditions based on stock availability and simulation duration.

## Requirements

- Emacs
- C Language
- OpenGL library (for graphics)
